# The reason of existence
Everything comes with necessties. Most of the time we face a situation where we just wanted to present a user friendly documentation for the user. Like upload the json collection and get the nice documentation.

Cases like, 
- you have to share the collection to the customer
- hosting a file to your own server for the API consumer
- or sharing it with the other team

In such cases we just want a basic document generator where we do not have to invest more time to understand that tool. A tool where we add our collection and it give us our document.

ApiDocMaker, take a collection and generate the downloadable REST API document for you.

Currently it support Postman API collections.
